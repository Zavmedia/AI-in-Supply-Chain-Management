🚀 AI in Supply Chain Management
Revolutionizing the Supply Chain with Intelligent Automation & Predictive Analytics

This project demonstrates how Artificial Intelligence can transform traditional supply chain processes into a smart, adaptive, and data-driven ecosystem. It includes a modular and scalable architecture that covers everything from demand forecasting to route optimization and supplier risk analysis — tailored especially for small to mid-sized businesses.

🧠 Features & Capabilities:
🔮 AI-Powered Demand Forecasting – Predict product demand with high accuracy using real-world sales and seasonal data.

📦 Smart Inventory Optimization – Maintain optimal stock levels and automate reorder decisions.

🚚 Route & Delivery Optimization – Suggest the fastest and most fuel-efficient delivery paths.

🏢 Supplier Risk Management – Analyze supplier behavior and recommend alternatives before disruptions occur.

🧾 NLP-Enabled Chatbot – Interact with your supply chain data using natural language queries.

📊 Interactive Dashboard – Visualize trends, forecasts, and live supply chain metrics in one place.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
