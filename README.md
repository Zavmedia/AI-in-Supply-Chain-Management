## 🧐 What is this?
Traditional supply chains can be messy and unpredictable. This project uses **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to turn that mess into a smart, data-driven ecosystem. We help businesses—especially small to mid-sized ones—manage everything from predicting what customers will buy to finding the fastest delivery routes.

## 💡 Why use it? (The Value)
- **Stop Stockouts**: know exactly how much to order so you never run out.
- **Save Money**: Spend less on fuel and warehouse storage.
- **Fast Decisions**: Automate complex math so you can focus on growing your business.
- **Better Logistics**: Get products to customers faster and more reliably.
